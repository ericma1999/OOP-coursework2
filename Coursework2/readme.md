# How to search
To search on multiple columns please click on each of the column header and a dialog box will pop up.
The search is inclusive ie. it would apply all search query you have input on each of the column

# For Graham
Regarding the bug for the flickering chart. I managed to make a work around for this coursework for now.
I had to set the layout of the chart to use GridLayout, as in this case i always want it to be at the bottom.
However, this limits the placement of the legend if another user wants to be position it to the left or to the right.
The sidepanel will show the current filters you have on


# Things to do if have time

- Make charts generate better colours using colour theory instead of just random</li>
- Add limit to showing per page, eg 50 results
- Improve error message instead of just generic error message
